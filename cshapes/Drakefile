;First iteration. Going to run this against the database, and see how far we get.
;Small dataset -- can rerun this many times. Later we'll add more sophisticated testing/dev.

;first step is creating the working schema

;this creates the geoinfra schema in the database. NOTE: this can be shared by all workflows. If the timestamp is up to date, it needn't be recreated if we request downstream steps.
